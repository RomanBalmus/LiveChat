# LiveChat
======

LiveChat is a small iOS app I'm using to learn Swift and tie in with xmpp authentication via [Ejabberd](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd) (though you could use your own two-legged XMPP provider).
It's not meant to be production-level code, just something you can hack away at and maybe use as a basis for something else.

## Project Goals

1. Learn Swift
2. Authenticate with and XMPP provider - Application grant, as well as resource owner.
3. Pull/Push/Sync message with the server

## Requirements

* [Ejabberd](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd) - Server-side component
* [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org)
